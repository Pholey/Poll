Poll Extraction Test
====================


Basically a test in which extracts needed information from Polldaddy to submit a vote, 
in as many different languages as possible.

Notes:
======

Brainfuck:
----------


Since brainfuck only has 8 items in it's syntax, this makes it impossible for http GET requests, meaning that
it is not possible to retrieve the data on it's own. My solution was using ruby with the brainfuck interpreter
in order to have our beautiful brainfuck syntax, but the useage of ruby. i intend to release my native interpreter
soon.

Other esoteric languages:
-------------------------

If you have a suggestion on one, then please feel free to contact me on one to use!!!
